# Project Governance

## Working Group

All of the Node.js Foundation websites, including this repo, are jointly governed
by a Working Group (WG). The WG is responsible for high-level guidance of this and
related projects.

The Website WG has final authority over this project including:

* Technical direction
* Project governance and process (including this policy)
* Contribution policy
* GitHub repository hosting
* Conduct guidelines
* Maintaining the list of additional Collaborators

## Collaborators

The [nodejs/nodejs.org](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org)
GitHub repository is maintained by the WG and additional Collaborators who are
added by the WG on an ongoing basis.

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are made
Collaborators and given commit-access to the project. These
individuals are identified by the WG.

_Note:_ If you make a significant contribution and are not considered
for commit-access log an issue or contact a WG member directly.

Modifications of the contents of the `nodejs/nodejs.org` repository are made on
a collaborative basis. Anybody with a GitHub account may propose a
modification via pull request and it will be considered by the project
Collaborators. All pull requests must be reviewed and accepted by a
Collaborator with sufficient expertise who is able to take full
responsibility for the change. In the case of pull requests proposed
by an existing Collaborator, an additional Collaborator is required
for sign-off. Consensus should be sought if additional Collaborators
participate and there is disagreement around a particular
modification.

Collaborators may opt to elevate significant or controversial
modifications, or modifications that have not found consensus to the
WG for discussion by assigning the ***WG-agenda*** tag to a pull
request or issue. The WG should serve as the final arbiter where
required.

## WG Membership

WG seats are not time-limited. There is no fixed size of the WG.
However, the expected target is between 6 and 12, to ensure adequate
coverage of important areas of expertise, balanced with the ability to
make decisions efficiently.

There is no specific set of requirements or qualifications for WG
membership beyond these rules.

The WG may add additional members to the WG by unanimous consensus.

A WG member may be removed from the WG by voluntary resignation, or by
unanimous consensus of all other WG members.

No more than 1/3 of the WG members may be affiliated with the same
employer.  If removal or resignation of a WG member, or a change of
employment by a WG member, creates a situation where more than 1/3 of
the WG membership shares an employer, then the situation must be
immediately remedied by the resignation or removal of one or more WG
members affiliated with the over-represented employer(s).
