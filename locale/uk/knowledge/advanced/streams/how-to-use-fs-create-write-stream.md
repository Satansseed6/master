The function `fs.createWriteStream()` creates a writable stream in a very simple manner. After a call to `fs.createWriteStream` with the filepath, you have a writeable stream to work with. It turns out that the response (as well as the request) objects are streams. So we will stream the `POST` data to the file `output`. Since the code is simple enough, it is pretty easy just to read through it and comment why each line is necessary.

    var http = require('http');
    var fs = require('fs');

    http.createServer(function(req, res) {
      // This opens up the writeable stream to `output`
      var writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('./output');

      // This pipes the POST data to the file
      req.pipe(writeStream);

      // After all the data is saved, respond with a simple html form so they can post more data
      req.on('end', function () {
        res.writeHead(200, {"content-type":"text/html"});
        res.end('<form method="POST"><input name="test" /><input type="submit"></form>');
      });

      // This is here incase any errors occur
      writeStream.on('error', function (err) {
        console.log(err);
      });
    }).listen(8080);
